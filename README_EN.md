# Convenient Mini Script Collection

This repository contains a series of convenient scripts designed for personal daily use, aimed at improving work efficiency and simplifying repetitive tasks.

## Introduction

In daily work and life, we often need to perform some simple but repetitive operations. The purpose of this script collection is to automate these common operations, save time, and improve efficiency.

## Script Categories

The scripts are categorized by function as follows:

- **File Operations**: Batch renaming, format conversion, file organization, etc.
- **System Tools**: System monitoring, automatic backup, cache cleaning, etc.
- **Development Aids**: Code formatting, dependency management, environment configuration, etc.
- **Network Tools**: Download assistance, API testing, network monitoring, etc.
- **Data Processing**: Data conversion, extraction, analysis, etc.
